# Prisma Folder - Database Schemas and Client

The `/prisma` folder contains the database schema and seed data. This follows Prisma's multi-file schema approach for better organization.

## Structure Overview

``` tsx
packages/database/
|--prisma/
|  |--schema/           # Multi-file Prisma schema
|  |--schema.prisma     # Main schema configuration
|  |--user.prisma       # User models
|--index.ts             # Database client configuration
|--keys.ts              # Environment Variable verification
|--seed/
|  ├── index.ts         # Main seed file
   ├── users.ts         # User seed data
```

### Model Files

Each entity has its own `.prisma` file for better organization
